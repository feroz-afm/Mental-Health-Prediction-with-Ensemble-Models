# Mental-Health-Prediction-with-Ensemble-Models
This repository presents a machine learning–based mental health prediction system built using multiple classical models and advanced ensemble learning techniques. The project focuses on improving predictive performance and robustness by combining diverse classifiers with systematic preprocessing, cross-validation, and hyperparameter optimization.
